## Early joiner (2019)

I joined as the first Software Engineer along side the CEO, and a couple of Data Scientists. I progressed naturally into Tech Lead, CTO and recently Principle Engineer role. In this article I will overview the learnings and the experience I had while growing with the company from a family-size team of 5 based in London, to a company of 160 people across New York and London offices.

## mission - save the web one neuronetwork at the time
I joined nate at an early stage, employee number five, four years ago. At the time nate mission was to automate mandane tasks on the web, using ML models. Simply put, we worked on developing a general ML model that would be able to perform checkout execution on any website. 
We wanted to deliver User Experience (UX) that would not require the shopper to do anything beyond the moment of decission or inspiration.
Share with nate and the product would be automatically bought for you.

One of the issues with automating tasks on the web, is that websites tend to change. There might be a new version of the website rolled out, A/B testing or other geo-location differences that if developed as a tailor-made solution it would mean that it needs to be constantly maintained as websites change, or their underlying technologies change.

At nate, we wanted to develop a robust solution that would be general enough to execute checkout on diffrent websites without breaking if the button moved a bit on the screen, or if HTML property name was changed. If you think about it, most of the sites have a similar structure. As their user, you land on the product page, select product variants, add to the bag, fill in shipping, billing, payments and finally place the order.

So we started with some Proof of concept (POC) booking airline tickets and pitched out the product as Business To Business (B2B) Application Programming Interface (API) offering to fashion aggregators.

## nate as b2b product (2019)

nate started as a b2b product. Essentially we were building a single API for the businesses. The idea was to offer companies such as fashion aggregators services for checkout automation. This way, they will have higher retention of their users on their websites with a smoother user experience. The only thing that was required from the integration is to submit purchase information: shipping, billing etc.. and wait until there was a final purchase status update - success or failure.

## nate b2c (2019)
After about six months we decided to focus on b2c solution. The idea was simple, build a new iOS client that will use the same B2B API.
And we did, after a couple of months, we soft-launched our iOS app in the US market.

What do we mean by soft launch?
We didn't want (and were not ready) to open our system to a wide range of people, so we decided to limit access to the app through somethign called waitlist. With a wait-list, the users might sign in to the app, but they will only be eligible to actually use the app when they are taken from that list, which was done manually, with a case by case review.

It was sort of “rehearsals” for a full launch and allowed us to simulate the future to come real-world interactions with our systems. 

And then we launched our first big marketing campaign on tiktok.

> Today, Nate, a free app that uses AI to enable checkout at any retailer, launches with the goal of making mobile checkouts a completely seamless process. Users are able to purchase items for themselves, or others, by tapping “share” then selecting Nate on a mobile device. Shipping and payment details are saved for easy reordering.

# 2020 - nate gifting

Additionally to purchase functionality, we decided to implemnt gifting feature. When you can send other nate users a gift, and if the receiver receives your gift nate will do the automation checkout. That way you dont necesserily need to know where person lives or how to ship the gift to him, you simply sent them the gift url and that's it.

# 2021 - Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) and Series A

Here we decided to develop a bespoke BNPL system, as all the other cool kids did at the time. After BNPL release we were able to close $38M Series A funding round, the biggest round for US B2C companies that year. All that happened in Q1/Q2 2021.

> Nate bags $38M: Shopping app nate has raised $38 million in a Series A round of funding, led by Renegade Partners, bringing the total equity raised to date to $51 million, according to the company. The New York-based company’s mobile app enables users to purchase any item at any online retailer. It also has an embedded social side where friends can share information about their purchases.

# the teams


Startup companies goes through multiple growth stages, each one of them comes with its own challanges. The phases I've been through at nate can be described as following:

## Stage 1: The Family (aka Household) - 1s

I joined as a Software Engineer and then I naturally grew in my role to Tech Lead. After a short while, I started to assemble the engineering function. 
The first hire we had on engineering team was a Junior guy, straight out of college, but his enthusiasm and willingness to learn overcome the lack of experience. 

Second hire on the engineering team was iOS Engineer with some industry background, and from then on we started building interviewing etc.

## Stage 2: The Tribe - 10s



## Stage 3: The Village - 100s


## Village

## City
We had a plan to get there but we never got there!
