# From Software Engineer to Tech Lead and Management
## Collection of experiences, thoughts from technical and personal perspective
## Early joiner (2019)

I joined nate as the first Software Engineer alongside the CEO and a small group of Data Scientists. After a while, I progressed naturally into Tech Lead leading the engineering function0, a couple of years later I moved to a CTO role and finally to a Principle Engineer. In this article, I will overview the learnings and the experience I had while growing with the company from a family-size team of 5 based in London to a company of 160 people across New York and London offices.

## Mission - save the web one neuronetwork at the time

I joined nate at an early stage, employee number five, in January 2019, just when nate was about to close its Pre-seed round. At the time nate mission was to automate mandate tasks on the web, using ML/AI models. Simply put, we worked on developing a general ML model that would be able to perform automation tasks on any website. We wanted to deliver a User Experience (UX) that would not require the shopper to do anything beyond the moment of decision/inspiration. Humans decide, and machines execute. That was our moto. Share with us and the product would be automatically bought for you.

One of the issues with automating tasks on the web is that websites tend to change. There might be a new version of the website rolled out, A/B testing or other geo-location differences that if developed as a tailor-made site-specific solution it would mean that it needs to be constantly maintained as websites change, or their underlying technologies change.

There's a reason why it's called Wild Wild Web. There are numerous ways to implement the same website's visual and functional design. This directly affects the way one would automate actions on the web through a simple script. But from the high-level perspective, the checkout flow is pretty much the same: Select product variants, add to bag, fill in shipping and billing forms and finally place your order.

At nate we decided to develop a robust solution that would be general enough to execute checkout on different websites without breaking functionality for small, insignificant changes such as if the button moved a bit on the screen, or if the HTML property name was changed. Started with some Proof of concept (POC) booking flight tickets and pitched out the product as a Business To Business (B2B) Application Programming Interface (API) as an offering to companies such as fashion aggregators.

## Product
In this section, I will cover briefly the product progress of nate. I will intentionally not mention anything regarding automation, platform and other technical internals that might be sensitive as public knowledge. Instead, I will give an overview of the public features and releases.

## 2019 - nate as b2b product

nate started as a b2b API product. The idea was to offer companies such as fashion aggregators services for checkout automation. This way, they will have higher retention of their users on their websites with a smoother user experience. The only thing that was required from the user integration is to submit purchase information: shipping, billing etc.. and wait until there was a final purchase status update - success or failure.

## 2019 - nate b2c

After about six months we decided to switch our focus from B2B to Bussiness to Customer (B2C). The idea was simple, build a new iOS client that will use already existing B2B API.
And we did, after a couple of months, we soft-launched our iOS app in the US market.

### What do we mean by soft launch?
We didn't want (and were not ready) to open our system to a wide range of people, so we decided to limit access to the app through a waitlist. With a waitlist, the users might sign in to the app, but they will only be eligible to actually use the app when they are taken from that list, which was done manually, with a case-by-case review.

It was sort of “rehearsals” for a full launch and allowed us to simulate future-to-come real-world interactions with our systems. 


> Today, Nate, a free app that uses AI to enable checkout at any retailer, launches with the goal of making mobile checkouts a completely seamless process. Users are able to purchase items for themselves, or others, by tapping “share” then selecting Nate on a mobile device. Shipping and payment details are saved for easy reordering.

# 2020 - nate gifting and product lists

This time we developed lists and gifting features. With lists, users could save their products as a collection of items. While gifts allowed two app users to send and accept (or decline) gifts to each other. Then we launched our first big marketing campaign on TikTok. With gifts you don't need to know where person lives or how to ship the gift to them, you simply sent them the gift url and if the gift recipient accepts it, it's automatically (auto-magically) shipped to their choice of address.

# 2021 - Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) and Series A

Here we decided to develop a bespoke Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) system, as all the other cool kids did at the time. As the name suggests, with BNPL one can buy now and pay later while splitting the original cost into four installments (kind of what Klarna was offering at the time).

After the BNPL release we were able to close a $38M Series A funding round, the biggest round for US B2C companies that year.

> Nate bags $38M: Shopping app nate has raised $38 million in a Series A round of funding, led by Renegade Partners, bringing the total equity raised to date to $51 million, according to the company. The New York-based company’s mobile app enables users to purchase any item at any online retailer. It also has an embedded social side where friends can share information about their purchases.

# 2021 - nate Wallet

With the wallet feature, we created the perception of nate cash. With nate cash users no longer need to pay with their cards directly, they can get nate cash and rewards etc..

# 2022 - nate social features
In 2022, nate went even more into the social direction. We implemented public user profiles, list visibility etc.

# The teams


Startup companies goes through multiple growth stages, each one of them comes with its own challanges. The phases I've been through at nate can be described as following:

## Stage 1: The Family (aka Household) - 1s

I joined as a Software Engineer and then I naturally grew in my role to Tech Lead. After a short while, I started to assemble the engineering function. 
The first hire we had on engineering team was a Junior guy, straight out of college, but his enthusiasm and willingness to learn overcome the lack of experience. 

Second hire on the engineering team was iOS Engineer with some industry background, and from then on we started building interviewing etc.

## Stage 2: The Tribe - 10s



## Stage 3: The Village - 100s


## Village

## City
We had a plan to get there but we never got there!
