# Manifesto

## The Moment

“I have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived – and dying I will tend to later.”

Remember that “Nothing REALY Matters.”

## Learn by doing / Thinking through making

- Learn by doing, keep your hands dirty in practice - As valuable as book-learning is, and as much as you can learn from watching YouTube videos, nothing can replace actually doing the thing. Don’t worry if you don’t do it correctly — or even well. Practice will help you improve. 
It also makes you less afraid of “looking bad.” If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing badly.

## Planing

“Premature optimization is the root of all evil.”— Donald E. Knuth

“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” - Albert Einstein

## Dealing with consequences

- Impact matters more than intent. However noble your intentions, if someone’s experience causes them to receive your words or actions in a way you don’t intend, you owe it to both of you to take a closer look.
- Do no harm - Striving for success is a good thing only if it does not harm others. A victory that comes at someone else’s expense won’t get you closer to becoming a person you’d be proud of.
- When shit happens, look at how to improve and move on.
- Live life with the full knowledge that your actions will remain. We are creatures of consequence - Zadie Smith

## Make knowledge-based decisions

Every believe or opinion we have we should take within a context - we are humans, not machines. We should embrace changing our position when we discover new information or ideas. We should avoid at al cost clinging to a mistake because we spent time making it, or cause we are afraid of our reputation and image affect.

- Always remember that it's never too late to change your mind - at any given point your decision is made based on known facts, if facts changes your decision might change as well
- I value standards, but I don’t idolise it.
- Avoid building mind models and labeling people around you with preconceptions

## Common assumptions

We tend to assume a lot. We come with pre-occupied knowledge and understanding of the world around us. It happens a lot when we assume that its obvious that everyone think as we do, when in reality no one thinks the same. And when we think that no one thinks like us, when in reality we’re part of the same flock.

## **Courage**

Courage to learn. Courage to be voulerable.

Without courage, there is no creativity.

- State the obvious, especially when it's too akward to do so
- Ask stupid questions without thinking about the affect of your reputation
- Learning is not compulsory neither is survival. Dr W Edwards Deming
- Endorse experimental and unconventional thinking
- Expect failure, failure is not an odd case
- Gardening is about admitting we don't have all the answers but being willing to pick up the seed packet regardless.

## Comfort Zone

Nothing ever grows in your comfort zone aside from apathy and mediocrity.It stops you from taking risks. It shames you which paradoxically it is trying to protect you from.

## Perfection

The pursuit of perfection destroys both the joy and depth of creativity. Perfection is a fallacy. It does not exist. Creative projects are never done. There are thousands of different directions you can take your creativity. It will drive yourself crazy.Seek excellence in your work but accept it will never, ever be perfect.

## On Ego & Creativity

We all have out true self - who we really are, and false self  - who we’re grown to be.

The false self is our ego. Usually we thing of ego as arrogance. And when the ego is inflated is certainly does do that. But our ego is a defence mechanism that protects us from shame and rejection. In order to do that it creates an identity based on beliefs.

As described by Psychologist, Dr. Nicole LePera *“Your ego is a very rigid identity. It has to be. It’s created a set of beliefs, patterns, and ideas, that most people label personality.*

Our ego will reject anything outside of confirmed thoughts or behaviours, it is very defensive.

Ego is both a strength and a weakness, its rigid identity full of self-limiting beliefs and a warped sense of our true potential. We must learn to navigate the ego if we wish to master our creativity.

We should not let our ego to kill our creativity. In order to create we need to be close to our true selves. Detachment from who we are will never bring us to creativity.

Our best creative work is achieved when we stop thinking, analysing, judging, trying to please others, or fir into social norms. In other words, when we drop our ego we tap into our creative genius.

Proving your position - instead of convincing someone else that your position is right and they are wrong, present your opinion in humble way and let them decide for themselves. Try avoiding ego clash situation.

## True-self instead of fitting to expectations

Be true in word and resolute in deed. Keep your word; what is said should be done. With everything we do, we should persist until it is completed. AIWEIWEI manifesto

Learning is not **compulsory** neither is survival. Dr W Edwards Deming
