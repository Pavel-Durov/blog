# Linux VNC server & macOS VNC client
If you, like me, have a Linux PC or a laptop at home but use your mac for work on a day-to-day basis. A local VNC server can be excellent if you want to run or do some experiments with a native Linux OS.

In my case, I am running different compilation processes that are CPU-specific. Since my mac comes with an M1 chip, not everything is 100% compatible, especially when you go to the more niche software or when new updates break some bizarre C lib dependencies üò∂.

So, here‚Äôs a guide on how I installed the local VNC server that I used daily in segregation with plain ssh when CLI access is just enough. But sometimes, GUI is all you need.

I will cover Linux VNC server setup and macOS client configuration, but as you probably guessed, you can also connect with not only macOS clients to the Linux VNC server.



## VNC server install & config

There are several options for VNC servers; we‚Äôre going to use x11vn [1]. VNC server allows you to view and interact remotely with a machine.

### Installation:

My Linux machine distro: Ubuntu 21.04

Installing VNC server and X window system:

```shell
$ sudo apt install lightdm x11vnc
```
You will be prompted with a message to choose a display manager. I chose lightdm [2], don't ask me why üôÉ.

Try running it after the installation to check that we‚Äôre good.

```bash
$ x11vnc
```
If all is good, you should see something like this; if not, then go fish üé£.

```shell
28/09/2022 17:58:12 *** XOpenDisplay failed. No -display or DISPLAY.
28/09/2022 17:58:12 *** Trying ‚Äú:0‚Äù in 4 seconds. Press Ctrl-C to abort.
28/09/2022 17:58:12 *** 1 2 3 4
28/09/2022 17:58:16 *** XOpenDisplay of ‚Äú:0‚Äù successful.
....
The VNC desktop is:      kimchi-machine:0
PORT=5900
```

This means that x11vnc could successfully identify X display :0. I guess that meant that we could try and connect to it ü§î!

But before that, let‚Äôs configure our VNC server ‚òùÔ∏è.


## Creating systemd service
It's up to you, really, you don‚Äôt have to create a service to run on the server, but if you want the VNC server to run in the background instead of launching it from your terminal every time and make sure that nothing is closed the terminal session, you do need it. And tbh it's pretty easy to do.

Create our vnc service config [3] ‚Äî located under/lib/systemd/system let‚Äôs call it vnc.service :
```shell
$ sudo vim /lib/systemd/system/vnc.service
```

I‚Äôm using vim as a text editor; you can use whatever. Here‚Äôs nano command:

```shell
$ sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/vnc.service
```

Then enter the following config,see comments for description:

```shell
[Unit]
# service description
Description=my local x11vnc kimchi service
# start this service after:
After=display-manager.service network.target syslog.target
[Service]
# the type of the service
Type=simple
# process config
ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -forever -display :0 -auth guess -passwd kimchi
# do this on process stop
ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc
# restart when failed
Restart=on-failure
[Install]
# start this service before multi-user target
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
You might ask ‚Äî whats multi-user.target? I‚Äôm not an expert, but a quick internet search revealed that in this context, it means that our service would start when the system reaches run level 2 [4]. I guess that‚Äôs cool to know üòê.

note that I set the password to be ‚Äúkimchi‚Äù, you should probably change it!

## starting our systemd service
Reaload systemd [5] to load our new service:

```shell
$ systemctl daemon-reload
```
Enable our service:
```shell
$ systemctl enable vnc.service
```
Start our service:
```shell
$ systemctl start vnc.service
```
Check our service status:
```shell
$ systemctl status x11vnc.service
```
Should get something like this:

If you ever want to stop our VNC service, run:

```shell
$ systemctl disable x11vnc.service
$ systemctl stop x11vnc.service
```

## Finally, connect from your mac
First, find your VNC server machine IP. You can do it by running:
```shell
$ ifconfig
```

the output differs between networks, mine looks like this:
```shell
enp5s0: flags=....
        inet ....
 broadcast 192.168.88.255
```
So we go the IP ‚Äî 192.168.88.255 üí™

Next, open up your Finder and navigate to GO > Connect to Server


![image.png](./assets/osx-finder.avif)

Enter the IP we got with the default port for VNC

IP ‚Äî 192.168.88.255

Port ‚Äî 5900

Protocol: VNC

All together now:
```shell
vnc://192.168.88.255:5900
```

You‚Äôll be prompted with a password. In case you forgot, its ‚Äúkimchi‚Äù (or whatever you set):

And Voil√†

That‚Äôs it!
